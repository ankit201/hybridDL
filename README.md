## Probability Of Credit Card Fraud

In this project we find out the probability of happening of credit card fraud. Here we take a clean dataset of all the customers who applied for the credit card in the bank and we at first found out which person is a fraud and who cheated by the DL model Self organised maps. Secondly we applied Artificial Neural Network to find out what is the probability that a person will cheat or not.
